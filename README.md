# Introduction to Intermediate JavaScript

## Pre-Requisites

This README is here to help you get context on where you are in your learning
path.

One of the prerequisites of this module is that you be able to create
"JavaScript DOM, event-based web applications." That means you understand:

* What the DOM is
* How to create HTML elements that make up a user interface
* How to configure event behavior
* How to use fetch()
* How to update the DOM, live, using JavaScript

If you're not feeling confident in one of these areas, be sure to get more
comfortable before continuing on.

Assuming you have these basics down, you're where most JavaScript developers
were during the late 90's and early 00's. Most web applications were the result
of a big, heavy server technology (like Java or ColdFusion) building an HTML
page and displaying it. JavaScript was used (if at all) to do things like input
validation and add flair. Basic JavaScript DOM programming, as listed in our
pre-requisites, was enough.

In the early 00's we started using JavaScript in more and more complicated
ways. Through that trial-and-error period a number of tools were wished for but
didn't exist. Fast-forward to the 2010's, a number of those tools came into
existence with ES6.

To make your life _vastly_ easier, we're going to teach you some advanced tools
for working with data in JavaScript. We're also going to cover some JavaScript
language fundamentals like type and conditional execution ("if-then"). With
some previous experience you'll find it easier to grasp these concepts and you
might find cool ways to apply them to what you already know.

## The Future

You'll definitely want to have these lessons' techniques on your side when you
start making really complicated JavaScript applications &mdash; as will happen
when you start writing object-oriented JavaScript **or** when you start trying
to use a JavaScript framework like React.

## Key Outcomes

* Identify specific instances' data-type from real-world contexts
* Use convenient data manipulation methods provided by ES6: arrow function,
  rest / spread / default parameters, etc.
* Uses Array "enumerator" methods: `map()`, `find()`, `filter()`, `reduce()`
* Change code flow with expressions within conditionals
